# Robot control in latent space
1. Collect data to learn the controllable latent state
   - [Collection process](docs/data_collection.md)
   - [Data Set](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/ranaras/EY3HbwFmY7BMrERzub-7MfwB350F99oxtRX1SL9c1z1MlA?e=PdycZ0)
2. Train a model to extract controllable latent state
3. Creating Latent state graph
4. Using image to get a latent state (LS)
5. Planning - Find a path from LS1 to LS2
6. Executing a plan on the robot
