# Robot control in latent space
1. Collect data to learn the controllable latent state
      - Data collection process
      - Experimental data
2. Train a model to extract controllable latent state
3. Creating Latent state graph
4. Using image to get a latent state (LS)
5. Planning - Find a path from LS1 to LS2
6. Executing a plan on the robot
