# Data collection process
   - The robotic arm's end effector was setup to move inside a 9 cell grid in front of the robot.  The joint positions for centroids of the 9 cell were recorded.  Five high level commands were used to navigate the grid.
     -  "Move North"
     -  "Move South"
     -  "Move East"
     -  "Move West"
     -  "Stay in place" 
   - Distractors
     - Large TV in the background
     - Orb light rotating through colors
     - Several flashing ornamental lights
   - A random policy was used to explore the grid.  Each time step consisted of 
     - Capturing a before image
     - Executing the move command on the robot
     - Capturing an after image
     - Recording the data to a csv file.
